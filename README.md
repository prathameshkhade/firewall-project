# Firewall Project
Impementing pfSense firewall in virtual network.

## Introduction

This project aims to simulate a representative network environment commonly found within organizations. By constructing a virtualized network, the project seeks to replicate the complexities and challenges associated with securing corporate infrastructure. A key focus will be the implementation and configuration of a firewall system to safeguard the simulated network from potential threats and malicious activities.

Through this hands-on approach, the project intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of network security principles and best practices. By replicating real-world scenarios, it will offer valuable insights into firewall deployment, configuration, and management.


## Project Goals and Objectives
